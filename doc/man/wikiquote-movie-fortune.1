We have a myriad of people adding quotes to Wikiquote. Why not
utilise this for
.BR fortune-mod ? Since the original
.BR wikiquote-fortune works for TV shows, this works for movies.
.SH NOTES
If you use wikiquote-movie-fortune to create a fortune cookie package
please consider submitting it to wikiquote-fortune-collection at
<https://github.com/maandree/wikiquote-fortune-collection>.
Doing so means that I can (unless you prefer to it yourself)
maintain it for the Arch Linux User Repository and will do my
best to make sure wikiquote-movie-fortune will work with new versions
of the Wikiquote page.
