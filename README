NAME
	wikiquote-movie-fortune - Generate fortune cookies from Wikiquote for movies

SYNOPSIS
	wikiquote-movie-fortune MOVIE_NAME [date-only]

DESCRIPTION
	Generates the file MOVIE_NAME with all quotes from the Wikiquote
	source for the movie MOVIE_NAME, and the file 'version' with the
	date and time the source was last edited, in the format
	yymmddHHMM.

OPTIONS
	date-only
		Do not generate the file MOVIE_NAME.

NOTES
	If you use wikiquote-movie-fortune to create a fortune cookie package
	please consider submitting it to wikiquote-fortune-collection at
	<https://github.com/maandree/wikiquote-fortune-collection>.
	Doing so means that I can (unless you prefer to it yourself)
	maintain it for the Arch Linux User Repository and will do my
	best to make sure wikiquote-movie-fortune will work with new versions
	of the Wikiquote page.

RATIONALE
	We have a myriad of people adding quotes to Wikiquote. Why not
	utilise this for fortune-mod? Since the original wikiquote-fortune
	works for TV shows, this works for movies.
